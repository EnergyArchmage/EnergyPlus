# This file documents the structural changes on the output of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
# This will eventually become a more structured file, but currently it isn't clear what format is best.
# As an intermediate solution, and to allow the form to be formed organically, this plain text file is being used.
# Entries should be clearly delimited.  It isn't expected that there will be but maybe a couple each release at most.
# Entries should also include some reference back to the repo.  At least a PR number or whatever.

# Example output change
The output tables were changed so that all column headers are now in ALL CAPS to ensure users are alerted to their presence.
This affects the SQL as well as other tabular output.

# Next output change
